# Boston Crime Analysis using Microsoft Fabric

This is a project that I use Microsoft Fabric (All in one) for ETL the dataset from KaggleApi. After ETL I create Data Warehouse and show the Report of Boston Crime. Furthermore, I will use Machine Learning and Pipeline Machine Learning for predict label of column 'UCR_PART'.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/thanhphat2609/Boston_Crime_Analysis.git
cd source
```

## Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

## Boston Crime Report with Power BI

## Pipeline of Machine Learning

## File Structure

- `boston_crime_etl.ipynb`: File for Extract data from Kaggle by using KaggleApi. After that is Transformation and Load into Data Warehouse.
- `boston_crime_ml.ipynb`: File for machine learning anh using pipeline machine learning in Spark for predict label of column 'UCR_PART'

Feel free to explore and enhance the project as needed!
